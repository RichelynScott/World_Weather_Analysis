# Module 6: World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize weather data from weather sources that require API keys for data access. We used the weather data in conjunction with google maps API to provide a multitude of potential vacation locations that were within the desired temperature range that the user selected (60 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit). Future application of this process will grant users the ability to enter in their preferred vacation weather and be shown a multitude of options along with hotels options in the nearest city. They will be able to enter their ideal temperature, view multiple locations and plan out an itinerary traveling between their destinations.

The above image shows all potential destination spots that meet the criteria of temp range of 60-90 degrees F. We then selected a cluster of 4 that were within relatively close proximity and that have access to a hotel in that city.

This map shows the specific travel between 4 fairly close cities that match the criteria, this journey would take the user through a beautiful journey in the south east portion of Africa, all in South Africa.
